# Installation

Of course, this is a Python script, which means you will need to run it with a Python interpreter.
However, for most cases, I recommend you run the following command;

**First, go inside the periodictable directory.** This step is important. And then, **run the following command:**

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

This will install all required packages... ***or...*** you could run the following in the directory;

```bash
make build
```

This is the same as doing `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`, but way cleaner.
This also means that you can **run** the file too with the following;

```bash
make run
```

Instead of having to step into the src directory, running python, yadda yadda yadda.
Anyways, that's it! Have fun messing around, and do note, **you can the `elementdata.json` file without any credits or permission,** but giving credit will help clarify stuff!

*(Unless you try to say that you made the `elementdata.json` file, you will be fine.)*
